Description
===========

This cookbook is used to configure a system with Oracle Express Edition 11g.

Requirements
============

You must download the RPM in advance from Oracle yourself and accept the EULA. The RPM must be placed on a server that can serve it up over HTTP, and you must set the attribute `node['oracle-xe']['url']` with that URL.

## Platforms

Oracle Express Edition 11g is only supported on:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6

and variants (Oracle Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Scientific)

# Usage

Include the default recipe in your run list after setting the URL attribute.

# Attributes

* `node['oracle-xe']['url']` - The URL where you've placed the Oracle 11g Express Edition RPM.
* `node['oracle-xe']['urldownload']` - Boolean whether to use url to download or use package resource (does not create a yum repo config file)
* `node['oracle-xe']['http-port']` - The port where you want the HTTP interface to be listening.
* `node['oracle-xe']['tnslsnr-port']` - The port where you want the TNS listener to be listening.
* `node['oracle-xe']['oracle-password']`  - The password for the SYS and SYSTEM accounts.
* `node['oracle-xe']['start-lsnr-on-boot']`  - Whether to start the TNS listener on bootup.

# Recipes

The default recipe installs Oracle 11g Express Edition.

Roadmap and Bugs
================

* Figure out why the response file doesn't actually seem to set SYS and SYSTEM passwords properly.
* Check Ohai data before doing anything to ensure the system has sufficient resources (cores, swap, memory) before running the RPM and having Oracle's installer fail.
